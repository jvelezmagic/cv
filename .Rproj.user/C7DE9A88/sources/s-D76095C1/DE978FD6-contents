### Genomic Scientist | Data Scientist

I love analyzing and visualizing data to improve our understanding of what is
around us. Besides, I am fascinated by software development, and I hope to
contribute valuable packages to the scientific community one day. I am known
for being a passionate, curious person and be always open to new challenges.
Do you have any challenges? Good! Let’s do it. Let’s be problem solvers.


Education and Training {data-icon=graduation-cap data-concise=true}

:::

### Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

B.S. in Genomic Sciences

Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico

2017 - 2021

Thesis: [Bacterial filamentation: a bet for survival in stressful environments](https://jvelezmagic.github.io/undergraduate_research_project/)


Research Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Undergrad Thesis Student

Center for Genomic Sciences

Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico

2018 - 2021

- I combined mathematical models with experimental microbiology to understand
  how exposure to antimicrobial substances triggers bacterial cells' stress
  responses. I have mainly focused on postulating a mathematical model
  showing that cell elongation can promote transient resistance to individual
  bacterial cells by diluting the antibiotic's intracellular concentration.

### Developer of R Software

Universität Heidelberg

Remote work, Germany

2020 - 2021

- Over the years, many different regulatory networks and statistical algorithms
  have been developed, mostly in a fixed combination of one network and one
  algorithm. To systematically evaluate both networks and algorithms,
  we developed [decoupleR](https://saezlab.github.io/decoupleR/), an R package
  that allows users to apply efficiently any combination provided.

### Assitant of National Researcher Level III or Emeritus

Center for Genomic Sciences

Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico

2019 - 2020

- Perform analysis of collections of massive expression experiments
  (_e.g._, RNA-seq) from _E. coli_ using uniform bioinformatic pipelines
  that allowed comparison with the transcriptional regulation network's
  classical experimental knowledge.

### Bioinformatician and Genomist

Centré de Regulació Genòmica

Barcelona, Spain

2019

- Differential expression analysis between the different conditions
  (_e.g._, deletions, overexpression, wild type) of transcriptional factors.
- Comparison of the expression profiles of genes regulated by transcriptional
  factors with the information available in _E. coli_ gene regulation
  databases (_e.g._, RegulonDB).

### Visiting Scientist

Center for Genomic Sciences

Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico

2018

- Design of R programs for the study of the topological properties of the E. coli transcriptional regulatory network.
